ORIOL MAR√çN ESCLASANS - NIA:216756

For this project I implement all the funcionalities of the part 2 and did some changes:

- Change the background of the game from a material and a png image from internet.
- Implement background music or ambientation for the game.
- Change the sound of the sheep hitted for a new one.
- Move the camera far from the plane making it better to play and watch the game.
